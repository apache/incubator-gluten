# Apache Gluten (Incubating)

**A Middle Layer for Offloading JVM-based SQL Engines' Execution to Native Engines**

[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/8452/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/8452)

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Apache Spark is a mature and stable project that has been under continuous development for many years. It is one of the most widely used frameworks for scaling out the processing of petabyte-scale datasets.
Over time, the Spark community has had to address significant performance challenges, which required a variety of optimizations. A major milestone came with Spark 2.0, where Whole-Stage Code Generation
replaced the Volcano Model, delivering up to a 2× speedup. Since then, most subsequent improvements have focused on the query plan level, while the performance of individual operators has almost stopped improving.

In recent years, several native SQL engines have been developed, such as ClickHouse and Velox. With features like native execution, columnar data formats, and vectorized
data processing, these engines can outperform Spark’s JVM-based SQL engine. However, they currently don't directly support Spark SQL execution.

### Design Overview

“Gluten” is Latin for "glue". The main goal of the Gluten project is to glue native engines to Spark SQL. Thus, we can benefit from the high performance of native engines and the high scalability enabled by the Spark ecosystem.

The basic design principle is to reuse Spark’s control flow, while offloading compute-intensive data processing to the native side. More specifically:

* Transform Spark’s physical plan to Substrait plan, then transform it to native engine's plan.
* Offload performance-critical data processing to native engine.
* Define clear JNI interfaces for native SQL engines.
* Allow easy switching between available native backends.
* Reuse Spark’s distributed control flow.
* Manage data sharing between JVM and native.
* Provide extensibility to support more native engines.

### Target Users

Gluten's target users include anyone who wants to fundamentally accelerate Spark SQL. As a plugin to Spark, Gluten requires no changes to the DataFrame API or SQL queries; users only need to configure it correctly.

## 2. Architecture

The overview chart is shown below. [Substrait](https://substrait.io/) provides a well-defined, cross-language specification for data compute operations. Spark’s physical plan is transformed into a Substrait plan,
which is then passed to the native side through a JNI call. On the native side, a chain of native operators is constructed and offloaded to the native engine. Gluten returns the results as a ColumnarBatch,
and Spark’s Columnar API (introduced in Spark 3.0) is used during execution. Gluten adopts the Apache Arrow data format as its underlying representation.

</p>
Currently, Gluten supports only ClickHouse and Velox backends. Velox is a C++ database acceleration library which provides reusable, extensible and high-performance data processing components. In addition, Gluten is designed to be extensible,
allowing support for additional backends in the future.

Gluten's key components:
* **Query Plan Conversion**: Converts Spark's physical plan to Substrait plan.
* **Unified Memory Management**: Manages native memory allocation.
* **Columnar Shuffle**: Handles shuffling of Gluten's columnar data. The shuffle service of Spark core is reused, while a columnar exchange operator is implemented to support Gluten's columnar data format.
* **Fallback Mechanism**: Provides fallback to vanilla Spark for unsupported operators. Gluten's ColumnarToRow (C2R) and RowToColumnar (R2C) convert data between Gluten's columnar format and Spark's internal row format to support fallback transitions.
* **Metrics**: Collected from Gluten native engine to help monitor execution, identify bugs, and diagnose performance bottlenecks. The metrics are displayed in Spark UI.
* **Shim Layer**: Ensures compatibility with multiple Spark versions. Gluten supports the latest 3–4 Spark releases during its development cycle, and currently supports Spark 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.

## 3. User Guide

Below is a basic configuration to enable Gluten in Spark.

```
export GLUTEN_JAR=/PATH/TO/GLUTEN_JAR
spark-shell \
  --master yarn --deploy-mode client \
  --conf spark.plugins=org.apache.gluten.GlutenPlugin \
  --conf spark.memory.offHeap.enabled=true \
  --conf spark.memory.offHeap.size=20g \
  --conf spark.driver.extraClassPath=${GLUTEN_JAR} \
  --conf spark.executor.extraClassPath=${GLUTEN_JAR} \
  --conf spark.shuffle.manager=org.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.ColumnarShuffleManager
  ...
```

There are two ways to acquire Gluten jar for the above configuration.

### Use Released JAR

Please download the tar package [here](https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/gluten/), then extract Gluten JAR from it.
Additionally, Gluten provides nightly builds based on the main branch for early testing. The nightly build JARs are available at [Apache Gluten Nightlies](https://nightlies.apache.org/gluten/).
They have been verified on Centos 7/8/9, Ubuntu 20.04/22.04.

### Build From Source

For **Velox** backend, please refer to [Velox.md](./docs/get-started/Velox.md) and [build-guide.md](./docs/get-started/build-guide.md).

For **ClickHouse** backend, please refer to [ClickHouse.md](./docs/get-started/ClickHouse.md).

The Gluten JAR will be generated under `/PATH/TO/GLUTEN/package/target/` after the build.

### Configurations

Common configurations used by Gluten are listed in [Configuration.md](./docs/Configuration.md). Velox specific configurations are listed in [velox-configuration.md](./docs/velox-configuration.md).

The Gluten Velox backend honors some Spark configurations, ignores others, and many are transparent to it. See [velox-spark-configuration.md](./docs/velox-spark-configuration.md) for details, and [velox-parquet-write-configuration.md](./docs/velox-parquet-write-configuration.md) for Parquet write configurations.
