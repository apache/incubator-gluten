# Test on Velox backend with TPC-H workload

## Test datasets
Parquet and DWRF (a fork of the ORC file format) format files are both supported. Here are the steps to generate the testing datasets:

### Generate the Parquet dataset
Please refer to the scripts in [parquet_dataset](./gen_data/parquet_dataset/) directory to generate parquet dataset. Note this script relies on the [spark-sql-perf](https://github.com/databricks/spark-sql-perf) and [tpch-dbgen](https://github.com/databricks/tpch-dbgen) package from Databricks. Note in the tpch-dbgen kits, we need to do a slight modification to allow Spark to convert the csv based content to parquet, please make sure to use this commit: [0469309147b42abac8857fa61b4cf69a6d3128a8](https://github.com/databricks/tpch-dbgen/commit/0469309147b42abac8857fa61b4cf69a6d3128a8)


In tpch_datagen_parquet.sh, several parameters should be configured according to the system.
```
spark_sql_perf_jar=/PATH/TO/spark-sql-perf_2.12-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
...
  --num-executors 14 
  --executor-cores 8 
  --conf spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=224 
...
```

In tpch_datagen_parquet.scala, the parameters and dirs should be configured as well.
```
val scaleFactor = "100" // scaleFactor defines the size of the dataset to generate (in GB).
val numPartitions = 200  // how many dsdgen partitions to run - number of input tasks.
...
val rootDir = "/PATH/TO/TPCH_PARQUET_PATH" // root directory of location to create data in.
val dbgenDir = "/PATH/TO/TPCH_DBGEN" // location of dbgen
```

## Test Queries
We provide the test queries in [TPC-H queries](../../../tools/gluten-it/common/src/main/resources/tpch-queries).
We also provide a scala script in [Run TPC-H](./run_tpch/) directory about how to run TPC-H queries.
Please note if you are using DWRF test, please remember to set the file format to DWRF in the code.
