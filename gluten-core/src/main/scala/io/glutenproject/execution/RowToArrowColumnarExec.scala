/**
 * Provides a common executor to translate an [[RDD]] of [[InternalRow]] into an [[RDD]] of
 * [[ColumnarBatch]]. This is inserted whenever such a transition is determined to be needed.
 *
 * This is similar to some of the code in ArrowConverters.scala and
 * [[org.apache.spark.sql.execution.arrow.ArrowWriter]]. That code is more specialized
 * to convert [[InternalRow]] to Arrow formatted data, but in the future if we make
 * [[OffHeapColumnVector]] internally Arrow formatted we may be able to replace much of that code.
 *
 * This is also similar to
 * [[org.apache.spark.sql.execution.vectorized.ColumnVectorUtils.populate()]] and
 * [[org.apache.spark.sql.execution.vectorized.ColumnVectorUtils.toBatch()]] toBatch is only ever
 * called from tests and can probably be removed, but populate is used by both Orc and Parquet
 * to initialize partition and missing columns. There is some chance that we could replace
 * populate with [[RowToColumnConverter]], but the performance requirements are different and it
 * would only be to reduce code.
