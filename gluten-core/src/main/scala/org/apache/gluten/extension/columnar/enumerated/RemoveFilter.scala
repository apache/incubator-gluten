// Removes Gluten filter operator if its no-op. Typically a Gluten filter is no-op when it
// pushes all of its conditions into the child scan.
//
// The rule is needed in RAS since our cost model treats all filter + scan plans with constant cost
// because the pushed filter is not considered in the model. Removing the filter will make
// optimizer choose a single scan as the winner sub-plan since a single scan's cost is lower than
// filter + scan.

  // A noop filter placeholder that indicates that all conditions are pushed into scan.
  //
  // This operator has zero cost in cost model to avoid planner from choosing the
  // original filter-scan that doesn't have all conditions pushed down to scan.
  //
  // We cannot simplify remove the filter to let planner choose the scan since by vanilla
  // Spark's definition the filter may have different output nullability than scan. So
  // we have to keep this empty filter to let the optimized tree have the identical output schema
  // with the original tree. If we simply remove the filter, possible UBs might be caused. For
  // example, redundant broadcast exchanges may be added by EnsureRequirements because the
  // broadcast join detects that its join keys' nullabilities have been changed. Then AQE
  // re-optimization could be broken by ValidateSparkPlan so that AQE could completely
  // have no effect as if it's off. This case can be observed by explicitly setting a higher
  // AQE logger level to make sure the validation log doesn't get suppressed, e.g.,
  // spark.sql.adaptive.logLevel=ERROR.
