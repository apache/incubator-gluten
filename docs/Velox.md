Currently, the mvn script can automatically fetch and build all dependency libraries incluing Velox and Arrow. Our nightly build still use Velox under oap-project. 

# 1 Prerequisite

Currently Gluten+Velox backend is only tested on <b>Ubuntu20.04</b>. Other kinds of OS support are still in progress </b>. The long term goal is to support several
common OS and conda env deployment.
Velox uses the script `setup-ubuntu.sh` to install all dependency libraries, but Arrow's dependency libraries are not installed. Velox also requires ninja for compilation.
So we need to install all of them manually. Also, we need to set up the `JAVA_HOME` env. Currently, <b>java 8</b> is required and the support for java 11/17 is not ready.

```shell script
## run as root
## install gcc and libraries to build arrow
apt-get update && apt-get install -y sudo locales wget tar tzdata git ccache cmake ninja-build build-essential llvm-11-dev clang-11 libiberty-dev libdwarf-dev libre2-dev libz-dev libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev openjdk-8-jdk maven
```
<b>For x86_64</b>
```shell script
## make sure jdk8 is used
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
<b>For aarch64</b>
```shell script
## make sure jdk8 is used
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-arm64
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
<b>Get gluten</b>
```shell script
## config maven, like proxy in ~/.m2/settings.xml

## fetch gluten code
git clone https://github.com/oap-project/gluten.git

```
# 2 Build Gluten with Velox Backend

It's recommended to use buildbundle-veloxbe.sh and build gluten in one script.
[Gluten Usage](./docs/GlutenUsage.md) listed the parameters and their default value of build command for your reference.

<b>For x86_64 build:</b>
```shell script
cd /path_to_gluten

## The script builds two jars for spark 3.2.2 and 3.3.1.
./dev/buildbundle-veloxbe.sh

## When you have successfully compiled once and changed some codes then compile again.
## you may use following command to skip the arrow, velox and protobuf build
# ./dev/buildbundle-veloxbe.sh --build_arrow_from_source=OFF --build_velox_from_source=OFF --build_protobuf=OFF

```

<b>For aarch64 build, set the CPU_TARGET to "aarch64":</b>
```shell script
export CPU_TARGET="aarch64"

cd /path_to_gluten

./tools/one_step_veloxbackend.sh
```

Alternatively you may build gluten step by step as below.

```shell script
## Set for aarch64 build
export CPU_TARGET="aarch64"

## fetch arrow and compile
cd /path_to_gluten/ep/build-arrow/src/
./get_arrow.sh
./build_arrow_for_velox.sh

## fetch velox
cd /path_to_gluten/ep/build-velox/src/
./get_velox.sh
## compile velox
./build_velox.sh

## compile gluten cpp
cd /path_to_gluten/cpp
./compile.sh --build_velox_backend=ON

### compile gluten jvm and package jar
cd /path_to_gluten
# For spark3.2.x
mvn clean package -Pbackends-velox -Pspark-3.2 -DskipTests
# For spark3.3.x
mvn clean package -Pbackends-velox -Pspark-3.3 -DskipTests

```

Once building successfully, the Jar file is generated in the directory: package/velox/spark32/target/gluten-spark3.2_2.12-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar. It's the only jar we need to config to Spark 3.2.2. Jar for spark3.3.1 is package/velox/spark32/target/gluten-spark3.3_1.12-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

## 2.1 Specify velox home directory

You can also clone the Velox source from [OAP/velox](https://github.com/oap-project/velox) to some other folder then specify it as below.

```shell script
step 1: recompile velox, set velox_home in build_velox.sh
cd /path_to_gluten/ep/build_velox/src
./build_velox.sh  --velox_home=/your_specified_velox_path  --build_velox_backend=ON

step 2: recompile gluten cpp folder, set velox_home in build_velox.sh
cd /path_to_gluten/cpp
./compile.sh --velox_home=/your_specified_velox_path

step 3: package jar
cd /path_to_gluten
# For spark3.2.x
mvn clean package -Pbackends-velox -Pspark-3.2 -DskipTests
# For spark3.3.x
mvn clean package -Pbackends-velox -Pspark-3.3 -DskipTests

```

## 2.2 Arrow home directory

Arrow home can be set as the same of Velox. We will soon switch to upstream Arrow. Currently the shuffle still uses Arrow's IPC interface.
You can also clone the Arrow source from [OAP/Arrow](https://github.com/oap-project/arrow) to some other folder then specify it as below.

```shell script
step 1: set ARROW_SOURCE_DIR in build_arrow_for_velox.sh and compile
cd /path_to_gluten/ep/build-arrow/src/
./build_arrow_for_velox.sh

step 2: set ARROW_ROOT in compile.sh or run with --arrow_root
cd /path_to_gluten/cpp
sh ./compile.sh --arrow_root=/your_arrow_lib

step 3: package jar
cd /path_to_gluten
# For spark3.2.x
mvn clean package -Pbackends-velox -Pspark-3.2 -DskipTests
# For spark3.3.x
mvn clean package -Pbackends-velox -Pspark-3.3 -DskipTests

```

## 2.3 HDFS support

Hadoop hdfs support is ready via the [libhdfs3](https://github.com/apache/hawq/tree/master/depends/libhdfs3) library. The libhdfs3 provides native API for Hadoop I/O without the drawbacks of JNI. It also provides advanced authentatication like Kerberos based. Please note this library has serveral depedencies which may require extra installations on Driver and Worker node.
On Ubuntu 20.04 the required depedencis are libiberty-dev, libxml2-dev, libkrb5-dev, libgsasl7-dev, libuuid1, uuid-dev. The packages can be installed via below command:
```
sudo apt install -y libiberty-dev libxml2-dev libkrb5-dev libgsasl7-dev libuuid1 uuid-dev
```
To build Gluten with HDFS support, below command is provided:
```
cd /path_to_gluten/ep/build-velox/src
./build_velox.sh --enable_hdfs=ON

cd /path_to_gluten/cpp
./compile.sh --enable_hdfs=ON

cd /path_to_gluten
mvn clean package -Pbackends-velox -Pspark-3.2 -Pfull-scala-compiler -DskipTests -Dcheckstyle.skip
```
Gluten HDFS support requires Hdfs URI, you can define this config in three ways:

1. spark-defaults.conf

```
spark.hadoop.fs.defaultFS hdfs://hdfshost:9000
```

2. envrionment variable `VELOX_HDFS`
```
// Spark local mode
export VELOX_HDFS="hdfs://hdfshost:9000"

// Spark Yarn cluster mode
--conf spark.executorEnv.VELOX_HDFS="hdfs://hdfshost:9000"
```

3. Hadoop's `core-site.xml` (recomended)
```
<property>
   <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
   <value>hdfs://hdfshost:9000</value>
</property>
```
If Gluten is used in a fully-prepared Hadoop cluster, we recommend to use Hadoop's config.

One typical deployment on Spark/HDFS cluster is to enable [short-circuit reading](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/ShortCircuitLocalReads.html). Short-circuit reads provide a substantial performance boost to many applications.

By default libhdfs3 does not set the default hdfs domain socket path to support HDFS short-circuit read. If this feature is required in HDFS setup, users may need to setup the domain socket path correctly by patching the libhdfs3 source code or by setting the correct config environment. In Gluten the short-circuit domain socket path is set to "/var/lib/hadoop-hdfs/dn_socket" in [build_velox.sh](https://github.com/oap-project/gluten/blob/main/ep/build-velox/src/build_velox.sh) So we need to make sure the folder existed and user has write access as below script.

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/hadoop-hdfs/
sudo chown <sparkuser>:<sparkuser> /var/lib/hadoop-hdfs/
```

You also need to add configuration to the "hdfs-site.xml" as below:

```
<property>
   <name>dfs.client.read.shortcircuit</name>
   <value>true</value>
</property>

<property>
   <name>dfs.domain.socket.path</name>
   <value>/var/lib/hadoop-hdfs/dn_socket</value>
</property>
```

## 2.4 Yarn Cluster mode

Hadoop Yarn mode is supported. Note libhdfs3 is used to read from HDFS, all its depedencies should be installed on each worker node. Users may requried to setup extra LD_LIBRARY_PATH if the depedencies are not on system's default library path. On Ubuntu 20.04 the dependencies can be installed with below command:
```
sudo apt install -y libiberty-dev libxml2-dev libkrb5-dev libgsasl7-dev libuuid1 uuid-dev
```
## 2.5 AWS S3 support

Velox supports S3 with the open source [AWS C++ SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp) and Gluten uses Velox S3 connector to connect with S3.
A new build option for S3(velox_enable_s3) is added. Below command is used to enable this feature
```
cd /path_to_gluten/ep/build-velox/src/
./build_velox.sh --enable_s3=ON

cd /path_to_gluten/cpp
./compile.sh --enable_s3=ON

cd /path_to_gluten
mvn clean package -Pbackends-velox -Pspark-3.2 -Pfull-scala-compiler -DskipTests -Dcheckstyle.skip
```
Currently to use S3 connector below configurations are required in spark-defaults.conf
```
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl           org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.SimpleAWSCredentialsProvider
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key     xxxx
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key     xxxx
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.endpoint https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled true
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access false
```

You can also use instance credentials by setting the following config
```
spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.use.instance.credentials true
```
If you are using instance credentials you do not have to set the access key or secret key.

Note if testing with local S3-like service(Minio/Ceph), users may need to use different values for these configurations. E.g., on Minio setup, the "spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access" need to set to "true".

## 2.6 Local Cache support
Velox supports local cache when reading data from HDFS/S3. The feature is very useful if remote storage is slow, e.g., reading from a public S3 bucket. With this feature, Velox can asynchronously cache the data on local disk when reading from remote storage, and the future reading requests on already cached blocks will be serviced from local cache files. To enable the local caching feature, below configurations are required:
```
spark.gluten.sql.columnar.backend.velox.cacheEnabled // enable or disable velox cache, default off
spark.gluten.sql.columnar.backend.velox.cachePath  // the folder to store the cache files, default to /tmp
spark.gluten.sql.columnar.backend.velox.cacheSize  // the total size of the cache, default to 128MB
spark.gluten.sql.columnar.backend.velox.cacheShards // the shards of the cache, default to 1
spark.gluten.sql.columnar.backend.velox.cacheIOThreads // the IO threads for cache promoting, default to 1
```
It's recommened to mount SSDs to the cache path to get the best performance of local caching. 
On the start up of Saprk contenxt, the cache files will be allocated under "spark.gluten.sql.columnar.backend.velox.cachePath", with UUID based suffix, e.g. "/tmp/cache.13e8ab65-3af4-46ac-8d28-ff99b2a9ec9b0". Currently Gluten is not able to reuse the cache from last run, and the old cache files are left there after Spark context shutdown.

# 3 Coverage

Spark3.3 has 387 functions in total. ~240 are commonly used. Velox's functions have two category, Presto and Spark. Presto has 124 functions implemented. Spark has 62 functions. Spark functions are verified to have the same result as Vanilla Spark. Some Presto functions have the same result as Vanilla Spark but some others have different. Gluten prefer to use Spark functions firstly. If it's not in Spark's list but implemented in Presto, we currently offload to Presto one until we noted some result mismatch, then we need to reimplement the function in Spark category. Gluten currently offloads 53 functions.

Here is the operator support list:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47296334/199826049-2ed7235a-f461-499d-917c-a83452b326c7.png)

Union operator is implemented in JVM, needn't to offload to native.

# 4 High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) support

Gluten supports allocating memory on HBM. This feature is optional and is disabled by default. It requires [Memkind library](http://memkind.github.io/memkind/) to be installed. Please follow memkind's [readme](https://github.com/memkind/memkind#memkind) to build and install all the dependencies and the library. 

To enable this feature in Gluten, users can. Below command is used to enable this feature.
```
cd /path_to_gluten/cpp
./compile.sh --enable_hbm

cd /path_to_gluten
mvn clean package -Pbackends-velox -Pspark-3.2 -Pfull-scala-compiler -DskipTests -Dcheckstyle.skip
```

Note that memory allocation fallback is also supported and cannot be turned off. If HBM is unavailable or fills up, the allocator will use default(DDR) memory.

During testing, it is possible that HBM is detected but not being used at runtime. The workaround is to set `MEMKIND_HBW_NODES` enviroment variable in the runtime environment. For the explaination to this variable, please refer to memkind's manual page. This can be set for all executors through spark conf, e.g. `--conf spark.executorEnv.MEMKIND_HBW_NODES=8-15`


# 5 Test TPC-H on Gluten with Velox backend

In Gluten, all 22 queries can be fully offloaded into Velox for computing.  

## 5.1 Data preparation

Considering current Velox does not fully support Decimal and Date data type, the [datagen script](../backends-velox/workload/tpch/gen_data/parquet_dataset/tpch_datagen_parquet.scala) transforms "Decimal-to-Double" and "Date-to-String". As a result, we need to modify the TPCH queries a bit. You can find the [modified TPC-H queries](../backends-velox/workload/tpch/tpch.queries.updated/).

## 5.2 Submit the Spark SQL job

Submit test script from spark-shell. You can find the scala code to [Run TPC-H](../backends-velox/workload/tpch/run_tpch/tpch_parquet.scala) as an example. Please remember to modify the location of TPC-H files as well as TPC-H queries in backends-velox/workload/tpch/run_tpch/tpch_parquet.scala before you run the testing. 

```
var parquet_file_path = "/PATH/TO/TPCH_PARQUET_PATH"
var gluten_root = "/PATH/TO/GLUTEN"
```

Below script shows an example about how to run the testing, you should modify the parameters such as executor cores, memory, offHeap size based on your environment. 

```shell script
export GLUTEN_JAR = /PATH/TO/GLUTEN/backends-velox/target/gluten-spark3.2_2.12-1.0.0-snapshot-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
cat tpch_parquet.scala | spark-shell --name tpch_powertest_velox \
  --master yarn --deploy-mode client \
  --conf spark.plugins=io.glutenproject.GlutenPlugin \
  --conf spark.gluten.sql.columnar.backend.lib=velox \
  --conf spark.driver.extraClassPath=${GLUTEN_JAR} \
  --conf spark.executor.extraClassPath=${GLUTEN_JAR} \
  --conf spark.memory.offHeap.enabled=true \
  --conf spark.memory.offHeap.size=20g \
  --conf spark.gluten.sql.columnar.forceshuffledhashjoin=true \
  --conf spark.shuffle.manager=org.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.ColumnarShuffleManager \
  --num-executors 6 \
  --executor-cores 6 \
  --driver-memory 20g \
  --executor-memory 25g \
  --conf spark.executor.memoryOverhead=5g \
  --conf spark.driver.maxResultSize=32g
```

Refer to [Gluten parameters ](./Configuration.md) for more details of each parameter used by Gluten.

## 5.3 Result
*wholestagetransformer* indicates that the offload works.
