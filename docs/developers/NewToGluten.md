Help users to debug and test with gluten.

For intel internal developer, you could refer to internal wiki  [New Employee Guide](https://wiki.ith.intel.com/display/HPDA/New+Employee+Guide) to get more information such as proxy settings,
Gluten has cpp code and java/scala code, we can use some useful IDE to read and debug.

# Environment

Now gluten supports Ubuntu20.04, Ubuntu22.04, centos8, centos7 and macOS.

## Openjdk8

### Environment setting

For root user, the environment variables file is `/etc/profile`, it will make effect for all the users.

For other user, you can set in `~/.bashrc`.

### Guide for ubuntu
The default JDK version in ubuntu is java11, we need to set to java8.

```bash
apt install openjdk-8-jdk
update-alternatives --config java
java -version
```

`--config java` to config java executable path, `javac` and other commands can also use this command to config.
For some other uses, we suggest to set `JAVA_HOME`.

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/
JRE_HOME=$JAVA_HOME/jre
export CLASSPATH=.:$JAVA_HOME/lib/dt.jar:$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar
# pay attention to $PATH double quote
export PATH="$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin"
```

> Must set PATH with double quote in ubuntu.

## Maven 3.6.3 or above

[Maven Dowload Page](https://maven.apache.org/docs/history.html)
And then set the environment setting.

## GCC 9.4 or above

# Compile gluten using debug mode

If you want to just debug java/scala code, there is no need to compile cpp code with debug mode.
You can just refer to [build-gluten-with-velox-backend](../get-started/Velox.md#2-build-gluten-with-velox-backend).

If you need to debug cpp code, please compile the backend code and gluten cpp code with debug mode.

```bash
## compile velox
./build_velox.sh --build_type=Debug
## compile arrow with tests required library
./build_arrow.sh
## compile gluten cpp with benchmark and tests to debug
cmake -DBUILD_VELOX_BACKEND=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

If you need to debug the tests in <gluten>/gluten-ut, You need to compile java code with `-P spark-ut`.

# Java/scala code development with Intellij

## Linux intellij local debug

Install the linux intellij version, and debug code locally.

- Ask your linux maintainer to install the desktop, and then restart the server.
- If you use Moba-XTerm to connect linux server, you don't need to install x11 server, If not (e.g. putty), please follow this guide:
[X11 Forwarding: Setup Instructions for Linux and Mac](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/11035-how-to-use-x11-forwarding.html)

- Download [intellij linux community version](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?fromIDE=#section=linux) to linux server
- Start Idea, `bash <idea_dir>/idea.sh`

Notes: Sometimes, your desktop may stop accidently, left idea running.

```bash
root@xx2:~bash idea-IC-221.5787.30/bin/idea.sh
Already running
root@xx2:~ps ux | grep intellij
root@xx2:kill -9 <pid>
```

And then restart idea.

## Windows/Mac intellij remote debug

If you have Ultimate intellij, you can try to debug remotely.

## Set up gluten project

- Make sure you have compiled gluten.
- Load the gluten by File->Open, select <gluten_home/pom.xml>.
- Activate your profiles such as <backends-velox>, and Reload Maven Project, you will find all your need modules have been activated.
- Create breakpoint and debug as you wish, maybe you can try `CTRL+N` to find `TestOperator` to start your test.

## Java/Scala code style

Intellij IDE supports importing settings for Java/Scala code style. You can import [intellij-codestyle.xml](../../dev/intellij-codestyle.xml) to your IDE.
See [Intellij guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-code-style.html#import-code-style).

To generate a fix for Java/Scala code style, you can run one or more of the below commands according to the code modules involved in your PR.

For Velox backend:
```
mvn spotless:apply -Pbackends-velox -Prss -Pspark-3.2 -Pspark-ut -DskipTests
mvn spotless:apply -Pbackends-velox -Prss -Pspark-3.3 -Pspark-ut -DskipTests
```
For Clickhouse backend:
```
mvn spotless:apply -Pbackends-clickhouse -Pspark-3.2 -Pspark-ut -DskipTests
mvn spotless:apply -Pbackends-clickhouse -Pspark-3.3 -Pspark-ut -DskipTests
```

# CPP code development with Visual Studio Code

This guide is for remote debug. We will connect the remote linux server by `SSH`.
Download the [windows vscode software](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
The important leftside bar is:
- Explorer (Project structure)
- Search
- Run and Debug
- Extensions (Install C/C++ Extension Pack, Remote Development, GitLens at least, C++ Test Mate is also suggested)
- Remote Explorer (Connect linux server by ssh command, click `+`, then input `ssh user@10.1.7.003`)
- Manage (Settings)

Input your password in the above pop-up window, it will take a few minutes to install linux vscode server in remote machine folder `~/.vscode-server`
If download failed, delete this folder and try again.

## Usage

### Set up project

File->Open Folder   // select gluten folder
Select cpp/CmakeList.txt as command prompt
Select gcc version as command prompt

### Settings

VSCode support 2 ways to set user setting.

- Manage->Command Palette(Open `settings.json`, search by `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`)
- Manage->Settings (Common setting)

### Build by vscode

VSCode will try to compile the debug version in <gluten_home>/build.
And we need to compile velox debug mode before, if you have compiled velox release mode, you just need to do.

```bash
# Build the velox debug version in <velox_home>/_build/debug
make debug EXTRA_CMAKE_FLAGS="-DVELOX_ENABLE_PARQUET=ON -DENABLE_HDFS=ON -DVELOX_BUILD_TESTING=OFF  -DVELOX_ENABLE_DUCKDB=ON -DVELOX_BUILD_TEST_UTILS=ON"
```

Then gluten will link velox debug library.
Just click `build` in bottom bar, you will get intellisense search and link.

### Debug

The default compile command does not enable test and benchmark, so we cannot get any executable file
Open the file in `<gluten_home>/.vscode/settings.json` (create if not exists)

```json
{
    "cmake.configureArgs": [
        "-DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON",
        "-DBUILD_TESTS=ON"
    ],
    "C_Cpp.default.configurationProvider": "ms-vscode.cmake-tools"
}
```

Then we can get some executables, take `velox_shuffle_writer_test` as example

Click `Run and Debug` to create launch.json in `<gluten_home>/.vscode/launch.json`
Click `Add Configuration` in the top of launch.json, select gdb launch or attach to exists program
launch.json example

```json

              "ignoreFailures": true
          }
      ]
    }

  ]
}
```

> Change `name`, `program`, `args` to yours

Then you can create breakpoint and debug in `Run and Debug` section.

### Velox debug

For some velox tests such as `ParquetReaderTest`, tests need to read the parquet file in `<velox_home>/velox/dwio/parquet/tests/examples`, you should let the screen on `ParquetReaderTest.cpp`, then click `Start Debuging`, otherwise you will raise No such file or directory exception

## Usefule notes

### Upgrade vscode

No need to upgrade vscode version, if upgraded, will download linux server again, switch update mode to off
Search `update` in Manage->Settings to turn off update mode

### Colour setting

```json
"workbench.colorTheme": "Quiet Light",
 "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
 "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
     "editor.wordHighlightBackground": "#063ef7",
     // "editor.selectionBackground": "#d1d1c6",
     // "tab.activeBackground": "#b8b9988c",
     "editor.selectionHighlightBackground": "#c5293e"
 },
```

### Clang format

Now gluten uses clang-format 12 to format source files.

```bash
apt-get install clang-format-12
```

Set config in `settings.json`

```json
"clang-format.executable": "clang-format-12",
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
```

If exists multiple clang-format version, formatOnSave may not take effect, specify the default formatter
Search `default formatter` in `Settings`, select Clang-Format.

If your formatOnSave still make no effect, you can use shortcut `SHIFT+ALT+F` to format one file mannually.

# Debug cpp code with coredump

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/DP_disk1/core
sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=/mnt/DP_disk1/core/core-%e-%p-%t
cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
# set the core file to unlimited size
echo "ulimit -c unlimited" >> ~/.bashrc
# then you will get the core file at `/mnt/DP_disk1/core` when the program crashes
# gdb -c corefile
# gdb <gluten_home>/cpp/build/releases/libgluten.so 'core-Executor task l-2000883-1671542526'
```

'core-Executor task l-2000883-1671542526' is the generated core file name.

```bash
(gdb) bt
(gdb) f7
(gdb) set print pretty on
(gdb) p *this
```

- Get the backtrace
- Switch to 7th stack
- Print the variable in a more readable way
- Print the variable fields

Sometimes you only get the cpp exception message, you can generate core dump file by the following code:
```cpp
char* p = nullptr;
*p = 'a';
```
or by the following commands:
- `gcore <pid>`
- `kill -s SIGSEGV <pid>`

# Debug cpp with gdb

You can use gdb to debug tests and benchmarks.
And also you can debug jni call.
Place the following code to your debug path.

```cpp
pid_t pid = getpid();
printf("----------------------------------pid: %lun", pid);
sleep(10);
```

You can also get the pid by java command or grep java program when executing unit test.

```bash
jps
1375551 ScalaTestRunner
ps ux | grep TestOperator
```

Execute gdb command to debug:
```bash
gdb attach <pid>
```

```bash
gdb attach 1375551
wait to attach....
(gdb) b <velox_home>/velox/substrait/SubstraitToVeloxPlan.cpp:577
(gdb) c
```

# Run TPC-H and TPC-DS

We supply `<gluten_home>/tools/gluten-it` to execute these queries
Refer to [velox_be.yml](https://github.com/oap-project/gluten/blob/main/.github/workflows/velox_be.yml)

# Run gluten+velox on clean machine

We can run gluten + velox on clean machine by one command (supported OS: Ubuntu20.04/22.04, Centos 7/8, etc.).
```
spark-shell --name run_gluten \
 --master yarn --deploy-mode client \
 --conf spark.plugins=io.glutenproject.GlutenPlugin \
 --conf spark.memory.offHeap.enabled=true \
 --conf spark.memory.offHeap.size=20g \
 --jars https://github.com/oap-project/gluten/releases/download/v1.0.0/gluten-velox-bundle-spark3.2_2.12-ubuntu_20.04-1.0.0.jar \
 --conf spark.shuffle.manager=org.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.ColumnarShuffleManager
```
