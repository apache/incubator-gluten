# Create Release Source and Binaries

The document provides a standard process for creating the sources and binaries that are required
for a release of Apache Gluten project with the Velox backend.

## Prerequisites

1. x86-64
2. Linux
3. Docker

## Steps to Create a Release

A standard release distribution can be created following the below steps.

### Pull and run the dev docker image

Pull and download the build environment docker image. The docker image is periodically
built and uploaded to DockerHub by scheduled GitHub Actions jobs.

```bash
docker pull apache/gluten:vcpkg-centos-7
docker run -it apache/gluten:vcpkg-centos-7 bash
```

### Clone the repository

In the docker container created by the last step, execute the following command to
clone the repository of Gluten with a specific git tag that you want to build on.

We are taking `v1.6.0-example-rc3` as an example git tag in this guide.

```bash
git clone --branch v1.6.0-example-rc3 https://github.com/apache/incubator-gluten.git /workspace
```

### Build

Build the project for all supported Spark versions.

```bash
cd /workspace
bash dev/release/build-release.sh
```

### Copy the target binaries to release directory

```bash
cd /workspace
mkdir -p release
copy -R package/target/* release/
```

### Package the release sources and binaries

By following this step you will create the release distribution that comply with the common name
convention of ASF project release process.

Note, the current tag should be specified when running this script.

```bash
cd /workspace
bash dev/release/package-release.sh v1.6.0-example-rc3
```

### Check the created release distribution

Confirm that all the needed sources and binaries are successfully created at the release directory
`$GLUTEN_HOME/release/`.

```bash
[root@8de83f716f0f workspace]# ls -l release/
total 481628
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  74396439 Oct 14 14:19 apache-gluten-1.6.0-example-incubating-src.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 104790092 Oct 14 14:19 apache-gluten-1.6.0-example-incubating-bin-spark-3.2.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 104767582 Oct 14 14:19 apache-gluten-1.6.0-example-incubating-bin-spark-3.3.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 104625356 Oct 14 14:19 apache-gluten-1.6.0-example-incubating-bin-spark-3.4.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 104595103 Oct 14 14:19 apache-gluten-1.6.0-example-incubating-bin-spark-3.5.tar.gz
```

# Publish the Release

This section outlines the steps for releasing Apache Gluten (incubating) according to the Apache release guidelines.
All projects under the Apache umbrella must adhere to the [Apache Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html). This guide is designed to assist you in comprehending the policy and navigating the process of releasing projects at Apache.

## Release Process

1. Prepare the release artifacts.

2. Upload the release artifacts to the SVN repository.

3. Verify the release artifacts.

4. Initiate a release vote.

5. Announce the results and the release.


### Prepare the release artifacts.

1. Create a branch from the target git repository.

2. Tag a RC and draft the release notes.

3. Build and Sign the release artifacts (including source archives, binaries, ...etc).

4. Generate checksums for the artifacts.


#### How to Sign the release artifacts.

1. Create a GPG key

2. Add the GPG key to the KEYS file

3. Sign the release artifacts with the GPG key.

```bash
# create a GPG key, after executing this command, select the first one RSA å’Œ RSA
$ gpg --full-generate-key

# list the GPG keys
$ gpg  --keyid-format SHORT --list-keys

# upload the GPG key to the key server, xxx is the GPG key id
# eg: pub rsa4096/4C21E346 2024-05-06 [SC], 4C21E346 is the GPG key id;
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-key xxx

# append the GPG key to the KEYS file the svn repository
# [IMPORTANT] Don't replace the KEYS file, just append the GPG key to the KEYS file. 
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/gluten/
$ (gpg --list-sigs xxx@apache.org && gpg --export --armor xxx@apache.org) >> KEYS 
$ svn ci -m "add gpg key" 

# sign the release artifacts, xxxx is xxx@apache.org
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg --local-user xxxx --armor --output $i.asc --detach-sig $i ; done
```


#### How to Generate checksums for the release artifacts.

```bash
# create the checksums
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; sha512sum  $i > $i.sha512 ; done
```


### Upload the release artifacts to the SVN repository.

1. Create a project directory in the SVN repository (1st time only).
   `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/gluten/`

2. Create a directory for the release artifacts in the SVN repository.
   `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/gluten/{release-version}`
   release-version format: apache-gluten-#.#.#-rc#

3. Upload the release artifacts to the SVN repository.
```bash
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/gluten/
$ cp /path/to/release/artifacts/* ./{release-version}/
$ svn add ./{release-version}/*
$ svn commit -m "add Apache Gluten release artifacts for {release-version}"
```

4. After the upload, please visit the link `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/gluten/{release-version}` to verify if the file upload is successful or not.
   The upload release artifacts should be include
```bash
* apache-gluten-#.#.#-incubating-src.tar.gz
* apache-gluten-#.#.#-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc
* apache-gluten-#.#.#-incubating-src.tar.gz.sha512
```


### Verify the release artifacts.

Please follow below steps to verify the release artifacts.

1. Check if the Download links are valid.

2. Check if the checksums and GPG signatures are valid.

3. Check if the release artifacts name is qualified and match with the current release.

4. Check if LICENSE and NOTICE files are correct.

5. Check if the License Headers are included in all files if necessary.

6. No unlicensed compiled archives bundled in source archive.


#### How to Verify the Signatures

Please follow below steps to verify the signatures.

```bash
# download KEYS
$ curl https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/gluten/KEYS > KEYS

# import KEYS and trust the key, please replace the email address with the one you want to trust.
$ gpg --import KEYS
$ gpg --edit-key xxx@apache.org
gpg> trust
gpg> 5
gpg> y
gpg> quit

# enter the directory where the release artifacts are located
$ cd /path/to/release/artifacts

# verify the signature
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg --verify $i.asc $i ; done

# if you see 'Good signature' in the output, it means the signature is valid.
```


#### How to Verify the checksums

Please follow below steps to verify the checksums
```bash
# verify the checksums
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; sha512sum --check  $i.sha512; done
```


### Initiate a release vote.

1. Email a vote request to dev@gluten.apache.org, requiring at least 3 PPMC +1s.

2. Allow 72 hours or until enough votes are collected.

3. Share the vote outcome on the dev list.

4. If successful, request a vote on general@incubator.apache.org, needing 3 PMC +1s.

5. Wait 72 hours or for sufficient votes.

6. Announce the results on the general list.
