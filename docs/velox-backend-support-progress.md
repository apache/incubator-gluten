title: Velox Backend's Supported Operators & Functions
nav_order: 4

# The Operators and Functions Support Progress

Gluten is still in active development. Here is a list of supported operators and functions.

Since the same function may have different semantics between Presto and Spark, Velox implement the functions in Presto category, if we note a different sematics from Spark, then the function is implemented in Spark category. So Gluten firstly will use Velox's spark category, if a function isn't implemented there then refer to Presto category.

The total supported functions' number for [Spark3.3 is 387](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/), Gluten supported 189 functions now.

| Value        | Description                                                                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| S            | Supported. Gluten or Velox supports fully.                                                |
| S*           | Mark for foldable expression that will be converted to alias after spark's optimization.  |
| [Blank Cell] | Not applicable case or needs to confirm.                                                  |
| PS           | Partial Support. Velox only partially supports it.                                        |
| NS           | Not Supported. Velox backend does not support it.                                         |


| Value      | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mismatched | Some functions are implemented by Velox, which return results mismatched with Apache Spark. So we marked then as "Mismatched".                                   |
| Ansi OFF   | Gluten doesn't support [ANSI mode](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-ansi-compliance.html). If it is enabled, Gluten will fall back to Vanilla Spark. |
